COMP 440 - Course Project: Phase 1
Spring 2023
Description
Consider the design of a database for an online store. Each item is identified by a unique item ID, a
title, a description of the item, the date the item is posted, price, and a list of categories (each category
is a single word in lower cases). Only registered users can post, buy, and review an item. Each registered
user is identified by a user ID or username (or both), a password, a first name, a last name, and an email
address. A user can give at most one review for each item, and on a particular day, the user can post at
most 3 items and 3 reviews. Meanwhile, an item can have no or many reviews. The review given by a
user provides a score of "Excellent, Good, fair, or poor" and then a short remark. A user cannot modify
an existing review that she/he gave earlier.
Some simple GUI interfaces are required for each functionality. All functionality must be performed
via the interface of your system. Direct SQL statement execution via any tools (MySQL
Workbench) can only be used for debugging purposes.
