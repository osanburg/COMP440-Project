Part 3: Deadline: Monday, 5/8, by midnight
Based on parts 1 & 2, implement the following functionality using your selected programing language
and SQL with necessary GUI interfaces. Part 3 emphasizes both the interfaces and their integration
with backend database operations. Each item has 6.25 points.
1. List the most expensive items in each category.
2. List the users who posted at least two items that are posted on the same day, one has a category
of X, and another has a category of Y. In terms of the user interface, you will implement two
text fields so that you can input one category into each text field, and the search will return the
user (or users) who (the same user) posted two different items on the same day, such that one
item has a category in the first text field and the other has a category in the second text field.
3. List all the items posted by user X, such that all the comments are "Excellent" or "good" for
these items (in other words, these items must have comments, but these items don't have any
other kinds of comments, such as "bad" or "fair" comments). User X is arbitrary and will be
determined by the instructor.
4. List the users who posted the most number of items since 5/1/2020 (inclusive); if there is a tie,
list all the users who have a tie.
5. List the other users who are favorited by both users X, and Y. Usernames X and Y will be
selected from dropdown menus by the instructor. In other words, the user (or users) C are the
favorite for both X and Y.
6. Display all the users who never posted any "excellent" items: an item is excellent if at least
three reviews are excellent.
7. Display all the users who never posted a "poor" review.
8. Display all the users who posted some reviews, but each of them is "poor".
9. Display those users such that each item they posted so far never received any "poor" reviews.
In other words, these users must have posted some items; however, these items have never
received any poor reviews or have not received any reviews at all.
10. List a user pair (A, B) such that they always gave each other "excellent" reviews for every single
item they posted.
