Part 1 â€“ Deadline: Monday, 03/27, by midnight
Use Java/C#/PHP/Python/C++ and SQL to implement the following functionality:

1. (6.25 pts) Create a database schema and implement a user registration and login interface so
  only a registered user can login into the system. The schema of the user table should be:
  user(username, password, firstName, lastName, email)
  username is the primary key, and email should be unique. You have to prevent the SQL
  injection attack. There is an attached pdf file about SQL injection attacks.
2. (6.25 pts) Sign up for a new user with information such as: username, password, password
  confirmed, first name, last name, email. Duplicate username, and email should be detected and
  fail the signup. Unmatching passwords should be detected, as well.
3. (6.25 pts) Implement a button called "Initialize Database." When a user clicks it, all necessary
  tables will be created (or recreated) automatically. Each table will be populated with at least 5
  tuples so that each query below will return some results.

How to submit:
1. The source code package. All files (source codes, class files, bat, and txt) should be contained
  in a war or zip file called comp440_teamNo_part1 for a team whose team number is teamNo
  submitted via Canvas.
2. A YouTube video. Use a recorder: https://www.apowersoft.com/free-online-screen-recorder.
  And upload your video to www.youtube.com. We only need you to record your screen and your
  voice for the project demo, not your face. You can add the YouTube URL to a readme file inside
  your project directory. You can create slides for your presentation if that is helpful, or you can
  use YouTube to record your video:

You need to come to the office hours or make an appointment with the instructor immediately if
you fail to complete part 1 by the due date. Please send an email to me to list all the challenges of
your project and where exactly you need help. Otherwise, you might not be able to do the remaining
parts of this project.
